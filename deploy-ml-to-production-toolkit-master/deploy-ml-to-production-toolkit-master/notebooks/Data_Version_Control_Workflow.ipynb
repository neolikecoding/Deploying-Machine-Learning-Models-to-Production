    "You can refer to [installation documentation](https://dvc.org/doc/get-started/install) for more help.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initialization:** You'll need to `dvc init && git commit -m 'initialize dvc'` to initialize your project to use DVC. \n",
    "After DVC initialization, a new directory `.dvc` will be created with config and `.gitignore` files and `cache` directory. These files and directories are hidden from a user in general and a user does not interact with these files directly. The last command, git commit, puts `.dvc/config` and `.dvc/.gitignore` files under Git control."

    "3. **Configure (Optional)**: Once you install DVC, you will be able to start using it (in its local setup) immediately. However, a remote storage (or remote) should be set up if you need to share data outside of a local environment. For example, to setup an S3 remote: `dvc remote add -d myremote s3://mybucket/myproject`. \n",
    " A remote can be specified by the remote type preffix and a path. As of this version, DVC supports six types of remotes:\n",
